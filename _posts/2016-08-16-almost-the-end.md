After three months of work, the GSoC is coming to its end. Before writing a final post about my work (as final submission to Google), here is a short post to talk about the past few days.

As I said in my previous post, I focused on documentation and cleaning. Thus, I especially wrote documentation for developers who may want to contribute to `dune-corepy`, see <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/michael.sghaier/dune-corepy/tree/master/doc/sphinx> (you can build the doc with `make doc` in the `build-cmake` directory of `dune-corepy`). I also did some refactoring for the bindings of `FieldVector`, `DynamicVector`, `FieldMatrix` and `DynamicMatrix`, see
<https://gitlab.dune-project.org/michael.sghaier/dune-corepy/commit/228a5e0d131f870ea051a53a2ee227ff647d7ae6> and <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/michael.sghaier/dune-corepy/commit/2480fef5ba8deff3552cfa97d2272e7a868aa276>. Finally, I worked on a merge request to harmonize the shared libraries generated by `dune-corepy`, see <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/michael.sghaier/dune-corepy/merge_requests/2>.

During the following days, I will be improving the documentation, testing `dune-corepy` to find bugs/issues and finally writing a final post on this blog.
